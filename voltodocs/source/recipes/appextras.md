# AppExtras component

The `AppExtras` component is a general use insertion point for things like analytics,
general purpose code spanning the whole application or third party services code. Using
it you can avoid to have to override `App.jsx` component.

## How to use it

You can use it by overriding it via Component Shadowing by placing a custom `src/customizations/components/theme/AppExtras/AppExtras.jsx`.
