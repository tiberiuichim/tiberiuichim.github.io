# Upgrade Guide

This upgrade guide lists all breaking changes in Volto and explains the
 steps that are necessary to upgrade to the lastest version.

!!! note
    There are times that updating the Volto boilerplate (the one generated by
    `@plone/create-volto-app`) is enough to fulfill all the changes. If you
    haven't heavilly modified it, moving things around and copying over your
    dependencies might do when dealing with upgrades. We keep the generator up
    to date and in sync with current Volto release.

## Upgrading to Volto 8.x.x

### Upgrade package.json testing configuration

The `dummy-addons-loader.js` file has been renamed to `jest-addons-loader.js`,
to be more in line with the rest of the existing files. You should add the
following value to the `moduleNameMapper` property of the `jest` key in your
project's package.json:

```
"load-volto-addons": "<rootDir>/node_modules/@plone/volto/jest-addons-loader.js",
```

## Upgrading to Volto 7.x.x

A misspelled file has been renamed. If you import `strickthrough.svg` in your
project, you'll now find that file at `@plone/volto/icons/strikethrough.svg`.

### New webpack resolve alias for Volto themes

As a "nice to have", a new resolve alias is provided that points to Volto's
theme folder. So, in your project's `theme.config` file, you can replace:

```less
@themesFolder: '../../node_modules/@plone/volto/theme/themes';
@siteFolder: "../../theme";
@fontPath : "../../@{theme}/assets/fonts";
```
with:

```less
@themesFolder: '~volto-themes';
@siteFolder: '~@package/../theme';
@fontPath: "~volto-themes/@{theme}/assets/fonts";
```

You might consider moving your theme files to a subfolder called `site`, to
prepare for the arrival of addons theming and their overrides.  In that case,
you would set your `@siteFolder` to:

```
@siteFolder: '~@package/../theme/site';
```

## Upgrading to Volto 6.x.x

First, update the `package.json` of your Volto project to Volto 6.x.x.

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@plone/volto": "6.0.0",
    ...
  }
```

!!! note
    This release includes a number of changes to the internal dependencies. If you have problems building your project, might be that you need to remove your `node_modules` and, ultimately, remove also your `yarn.lock` file. Then run again `yarn` for rebuilding dependencies.

### Upgrade to Node 12

We have now dependencies that requires `node >=10.19.0`. Although Node 10 has still LTS
"maintenance" treatment (see https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) the recommended path
is that you use from now on node 12 which is LTS since last October.

### New Razzle version and related development dependencies

The underlying Razzle package has been upgraded, and although that does not suppose any
change in Volto itself, a lot of development dependencies have been upgraded and they should be updated in your local projects as well. Might be that the builds continue working if you don't update them, but it's better for you to do so for a better development experience.

### Upgrade local dependencies versions

You need to update `devDependencies` in `package.json` in your local environment:

```json
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint-plugin-prettier": "3.1.3",
    "prettier": "2.0.5",
    "stylelint-config-idiomatic-order": "8.1.0",
    "stylelint-config-prettier": "8.0.1",
    "stylelint-prettier": "1.1.2",
  }
```

and remove entirely the `resolutions` key:

```json
  "resolutions": {
    "@plone/volto/razzle/webpack-dev-server": "3.2.0"
  }
```

### Update `package.json` config

Add this key to the `jest.moduleNameMapper`:

```json
"jest":
  "moduleNameMapper": {
    "@plone/volto/babel": "<rootDir>/node_modules/@plone/volto/babel",
    ...
  }
```

because new Jest is a bit more picky when importing externals.

### Prettier

Prettier has been updated, introducing some breaking formatting changes. It's recommended that you upgrade your local version of `prettier` and reformat your code with it using:

`yarn prettier:fix`

### Stylelint

`stylelint` has been upgraded too, and it introduces some changes in the declaration
of the styles order. It's recommended that you upgrade your local version of `prettier` and reformat your code with it using:

`yarn stylelint:fix`

### CSS modules are not supported anymore

Razzle does not support them anymore, so neither do we. If you need them, you could add
a Webpack config in your local `razzle.config.js`.

### Update your eslint config

Introduced in the Volto 5 series, it's recommended that you update your local ESLint config. In the past, we used `.eslintrc` file to do so. In order to support automatically Volto addons, you should remove it and use a JS based config one `.eslintrc.js` with this contents:

```js
const path = require('path');
const projectRootPath = path.resolve('.');
const packageJson = require(path.join(projectRootPath, 'package.json'));

// Extends ESlint configuration for adding the aliases to `src` directories in Volto addons
const addonsAliases = [];
if (packageJson.addons) {
  const addons = packageJson.addons;
  addons.forEach(addon => {
    const addonPath = `${addon}/src`;
    addonsAliases.push([addon, addonPath]);
  });
}

module.exports = {
  extends: './node_modules/@plone/volto/.eslintrc',
  settings: {
    'import/resolver': {
      alias: {
        map: [
          ['@plone/volto', '@plone/volto/src'],
          ...addonsAliases,
          ['@package', './src'],
        ],
        extensions: ['.js', '.jsx', '.json'],
      },
      'babel-plugin-root-import': {
        rootPathSuffix: 'src',
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### New wrappers in block editor

We have improved the overall UX of the block drag and drop feature by using the library
`react-beautiful-dnd` in the block editor. It introduces new wrappers (belonging to the
lib machinery) in the structure. The original structure and class names are still in
there (as children of these wrappers) to maintain maximum backwards compatibility. Those
might be cleaned up in next major versions, so if for some reason you have customized
the styling of your blocks in edit mode relying in the old structure, you might want to
review and adapt them.

### Update `config.js`

!!! note
    This is required since Volto version 6.1.0 [1541](https://github.com/plone/volto/pull/1541)

Add these to the `config.js` of your project:

```js
export const addonRoutes = [];

export const addonReducers = {};
```

## Upgrading to Volto 5.x.x

First, update the `package.json` of your Volto project to Volto 5.x.x.

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@plone/volto": "5.0.0",
    ...
  }
```

### New lazy loading boilerplate

Volto is now capable of splitting and lazy load components. This allows for better
performance and reduced bundle sizes, the client also has to parse and load less code,
improving the user experience, specially on mobile devices.

The boilerplate includes changes in the structural foundation of Volto itself. So if you
have updated in your projects any of these components:

- `src/helpers/Html/Html.jsx`
- `src/components/theme/App/App.jsx`
- `src/server.jsx`
- `src/client.jsx`

you should adapt them to the newests changes in Volto source code. You can do that by
diffing the new ones with yours.

### Testing lazy load components

The whole process has been designed to have a minimal impact in existing projects.
However, only a thing should be changed in your components tests. Specially if your components are composed of original Volto components (not SemanticUI ones, though).

You should adapt them by mocking the Volto component or resolve (await) for them in an
async construction before the test is fired. See this Codepen example:

https://codesandbox.io/s/loadable-async-tests-l2bx9

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { render } from "@testing-library/react";
import App from "./App";
import { Component1, Component2 } from "./components";

describe("CustomComponent", () => {
  it("rendered lazily", async () => {
    const { container, getByText } = render(<App />);

    await Component1;
    await Component2;

    expect(container.firstChild).toMatchSnapshot();
    expect(getByText("Component1"));
    expect(getByText("Component2"));
  });
```

This is also another pattern used in Volto core for testing, you can transform your test
in async aware like this:

```diff

+    await wait(() => {
+      expect(component.toJSON()).toMatchSnapshot();
+    });
   });
 });
```

### Helmet title now it's centralized in `View.jsx`

All the calls for update the title in the document performed by `Helmet` are now
centralized in the `View.jsx` components. It's recommended to remove all the Helmet
calls for updating the title from your components specially if you are using some of the
SEO addons for Volto, since not doing that could interfere with them.

## Upgrading to Volto 4.x.x

First, update your `package.json` to Volto 4.x.x.

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@plone/volto": "4.0.0",
    ...
  }
```

### New initial blocks per content type setting in Alpha 37

Not breaking change, but now there's a new setting in Blocks, `initialBlocks` where you can define a the initial blocks for all content types. You can override the default ('title' and a 'text' block) and provide your own by modifying the configuration object:

```js
const initialBlocks = {
    Document: ['leadimage', 'title', 'text', 'listing' ]
};
```

provide an empty object if you don't want to define any additional initial blocks and keep the default.

```js
const initialBlocks = {};
```

### ImageSidebar moved to Image Block directory in Alpha 29

For better resource grouping, the `ImageSidebar` component has been moved to the `Image` block component directory: `components/manage/Blocks/Image`

### Copy `yarn.lock` from volto-starter-kit in Alpha 17

Due to changes in the dependency tree, it's required to use an specific `yarn.lock` file by deleting it and copy the one here: https://github.com/plone/volto-starter-kit/blob/master/yarn.lock before upgrading to Volto alpha 17.

### Forked Helmet into Volto core

Due to the inactivity of the Helmet project, we decided to fork it to the core. It's part of the Volto helpers now. You have to update your imports accordingly. Please notice that now it's a named import:

```diff
--- a/src/components/Views/ReportView.jsx

 import { format, parse } from 'date-fns';
 import { filter, map } from 'lodash';
```

### Alpha 16 is a brownbag release

There was a problem with the projects using Volto eslint config when upgrading to latest versions related to typescript, we will take of that in the near future. So skip this version.

### Stylelint and prettier config in Alpha 14

In your project's boilerplate, you need to update the stylelint and prettier configuration accordingly to the changes made in Alpha 14 in `package.json` like this:

### openObjectBrowser API change in Alpha 11

The API of the `ObjectBrowser` component changed in alpha 11 to make it more flexible.
In case you had custom blocks using it, you have to update the call in case you were using a `link` mode:

```diff

```

See the [blocks section](../blocks/editcomponent.md#openobjectbrowser-handler-api) for more details.

### Renaming Tiles into Blocks

An internal renaming to use the term `Blocks` everywhere was done to unify naming through the code a and the documentation.

Plone RESTAPI was updated to that purpose too, and running an upgrade step (do so in Plone's Addons control panel) is required in order to migrate the data. No step is required if you are using a brand new ZODB.

This is the versions compatibility table across all the packages involved:

Volto 4 - plone.restapi >= 5.0.0 - kitconcept.voltodemo >= 2.0

!!! note
    The renaming happened in Volto 4 alpha.10 and plone.restapi 5.0.0. Volto 4 alpha versions under that release use older versions of `plone.restapi` and `kitconcept.voltodemo`, however if you are using alpha releases it's recommended to upgrade to latest alpha or the final release of Volto 4.

The project configuration should also be updated, in your `src/config.js`:

```diff
diff --git a/src/config.js b/src/config.js

### Add theme customization to your project

Volto 4 now also expects a file named `src/theme.js` with this content by default:

```js
import 'semantic-ui-less/semantic.less';
import '@plone/volto/../theme/themes/pastanaga/extras/extras.less';
```

### Remove enzyme configuration

Enzyme has been removed, in favor of `@testing-library/react`, and the configuration should be removed in `package.json`:

```

### Blocks engine - Blocks configuration object

The blocks engine was updated and there are some important breaking changes, in case that
you've developed custom blocks. The configuration object is now unified and expresses all
the properties to model a block. This is how a block in the `defaultBlocks` object looks
like:

```js
const defaultBlocks = {
  title: {
    id: 'title', // The name (id) of the block
    title: 'Title', // The display name of the block
    icon: titleSVG, // The icon used in the block chooser
    group: 'text', // The group (blocks can be grouped, displayed in the chooser)
    view: ViewTitleBlock, // The view mode component
    edit: EditTitleBlock, // The edit mode component
    restricted: false, // If the block is restricted, it won't show in in the chooser
    mostUsed: false, // A meta group `most used`, appearing at the top of the chooser
    blockHasOwnFocusManagement: false, // Set this to true if the block manages its own focus
    security: {
      addPermission: [], // Future proof (not implemented yet) add user permission role(s)
      view: [], // Future proof (not implemented yet) view user role(s)
    },
  },
  ...
```

There is an additional object `groupBlocksOrder` that contains an array with the order
that the blocks group should appear:

```js
const groupBlocksOrder = [
  { id: 'mostUsed', title: 'Most used' },
  { id: 'text', title: 'Text' },
  { id: 'media', title: 'Media' },
  { id: 'common', title: 'Common' },
];
```

You should adapt and merge the configuration of your own custom blocks to match the
`defaultBlocks` and `groupBlocksOrder` one. You can modify the order of the groups and
create your own as well.

### Blocks engine - Simplification of the edit blocks wrapper

The edit block wrapper boilerplate was quite big, and for bootstrap an edit block you had to copy it from an existing block. Now all this boilerplate has been transferred to the Blocks Engine, so bootstrapping the edit component of a block is easier and do not require any pre-existing code.

In order to upgrade your blocks you should simplify the outter `<div>` (took as example the Title block):

``` diff
--- a/src/components/manage/Blocks/Title/Edit.jsx
+++ b/src/components/manage/Blocks/Title/Edit.jsx

-      >

           }}
         />
-      </div>
+      </>
     );
   }
 }
```

The blocks engine now takes care for the keyboard navigation of the blocks, so you need to remove the outter `<div>` from your custom block, then your block doesn't have to react to the change on `this.props.selected` either, because it's also something that the blocks engine already does for you.

The focus management is also transferred to the engine, so no needed for your block to manage the focus. However, if your block does indeed require to manage its own focus, then you should mark it with the `blockHasOwnFocusManagement` property in the blocks configuration object:

``` js hl_lines="10"
    text: {
      id: 'text',
      title: 'Text',
      icon: textSVG,
      group: 'text',
      view: ViewTextBlock,
      edit: EditTextBlock,
      restricted: false,
      mostUsed: false,
      blockHasOwnFocusManagement: true,
      security: {
        addPermission: [],
        view: [],
      },
    },
```

### Default view renaming

The default view for content types `DocumentView.jsx` has been renamed to a more appropiate `DefaultView.jsx`. This view contains the code for rendering blocks in case the content type has been Blocks enabled. Enable Blocks on your content types by composing the view of your content type using `DefaultView` component.

### Deprecations

- The old messages container has been removed since it's not used anymore by Volto. We changed it to use `Toast` library.
- Improve the Pastanaga Editor block wrapper container layout, deprecating the hack `.ui.wrapper > *`.

## Upgrading to Volto 3.x

Volto was upgraded to use Razzle 3.0.0 which is not a breaking change itself,
but it forces to some changes in the boilerplate on your Volto projects. You
should change the babel config by deleting .babelrc file and creating a new
file `babel.config.js` with these contents:

```js
module.exports = require('@plone/volto/babel');
```

Then update your `package.json` to Volto 3.x.

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@plone/volto": "3.0.0",
    ...
  }
```

Volto 3.x is compatible with the new changes introduced in the vocabularies
endpoint in plone.restapi 4.0.0. If you custom build a widget based in the
Volto ones, you should update them as well. Volto updated its own widget set to
support them:

- `components/manage/Widgets/ArrayWidget`
- `components/manage/Widgets/SelectWidget`
- `components/manage/Widgets/TokenWidget`

They all use `react-select` third party library for render it.

## Upgrading to Volto 2.x

### Improved Blocks HOC

The Blocks HOC (High Order Component) was changed to lift off some of the
features from the blocks themselves and now it takes care of them by its own.

- The delete block feature was moved to it
- The keylisteners for navigating through blocks was moved to it
- The properties passed down to the blocks are improved and documented

This change only applies to your existing blocks, you have to update them
accordingly by delete the trash icon and action from the end of your blocks

```jsx
{this.props.selected && (
  <Button
    icon
    basic
    onClick={() => this.props.onDeleteBlock(this.props.block)}
    className="block-delete-button"
  >
    <Icon name={trashSVG} size="18px" />
  </Button>
)}
```

Modify the parent element of your block making this changes:

```jsx
<div
  role="presentation"
  onClick={() => this.props.onSelectBlock(this.props.block)}
  className={cx('block hero', {
    selected: this.props.selected,
  })}
  tabIndex={0}
  onKeyDown={e =>
    this.props.handleKeyDown(
      e,
      this.props.index,
      this.props.block,
      this.node
    )
  }
  ref={node => {
    this.node = node;
  }}
>
```

- Add the keylisteners to the parent element of your block

```jsx
  onKeyDown={e =>
    this.props.handleKeyDown(
      e,
      this.props.index,
      this.props.block,
      this.node
    )
  }
```

- Add a ref to it and assign it to `this.node`.

```jsx
  ref={node => {
    this.node = node;
  }}
```

- Add a proper role for it

```jsx
  role="presentation"
```

Take a look into the implementation of the default Volto blocks to get a grasp
on all the edge cases related to keyboard navigation and how to deal with them.

### Reordering of the internal CSS, added an extra

The internal Volto CSS has been tidied up and reordered, for that reason, some
other extras have been introduced and the theme.config in your project needs to
be updated by making sure you have these two extras in the
`theme.config` file:

```less
/* Extras */
@main        : 'pastanaga';
@custom      : 'pastanaga';
```
