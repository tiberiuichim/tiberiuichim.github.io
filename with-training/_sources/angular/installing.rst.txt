Installing The Development Environment
======================================

First, we need NodeJS 6.10+. We recommend to use nvm to install NodeJS instead of using your OS-based version.

Install nvm on your system using the instructions and provided script at:

https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install-script

Using nvm we will look up the latest lts version of NodeJS and install it

.. code-block:: console

   nvm ls-remote --lts
   nvm install v6.10
   nvm use v6.10

NodeJS is provided with npm, its package manager, we will use it to install the Angular CLI (ng)

.. code-block:: console

   npm install -g @angular/cli@latest

.. note:: ``-g`` means the CLI will be available globally in our nvm instance.

Initializing A New Project
==========================

The CLI allows to initialize a project:

.. code-block:: console

   ng new training --style=scss

.. note:: ``--style=scss`` indicates we will use SCSS for stylesheets.

If we inspect our newly created ``./training``, we see a default Angular project structure:

- the sources are managed in the ``./src`` folder,
- the dependencies are declared in ``package.json``,
- and they are installed in the ``./node_modules`` folder.

We can serve our project locally using the CLI.

.. code-block:: console

   cd ./training
   ng serve

The result can be seen on http://localhost:4200.

This development server offers the different features we can expect for a convenient frontend developement environment
like autoreload and sourcemaps.

The CLI also allows to run the tests:

.. code-block:: console

   ng test
