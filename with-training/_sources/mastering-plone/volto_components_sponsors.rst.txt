  This chapter is about the React frontend Volto.

  .. topic:: Description

      Create a React component for content fetched from the backend

  Solve the same tasks in classic frontend: :doc:`viewlets_advanced_classic`


.. sidebar:: Get the code! (:doc:`More info <code>`)

   Code for the beginning of this chapter::

       git checkout TODO tag to checkout

   Code for the end of this chapter::

        git checkout TODO tag to checkout


In the previous chapter :doc:`dexterity_3` you created the ``sponsor`` content type.
Now let's learn how to display content of this type.

To be solved task in this part:

* Advert to sponsors on all pages, sorted by level

In this part you will:

* Display data from collected content

Topics covered:

* Create React component
* Use React action of Volto to fetch data from Plone via REST API
* Style component with Semantic UI

.. figure:: _static/volto_component_sponsors.png
   :alt: Sponsors component


.. only:: not presentation

  For sponsors we will stay with the default view as we will only display the sponsors in the footer and do not modify their own pages.
  The default-view of Volto does not show any of the custom fields you added to the sponsors.
  Using what you learned in :doc:`volto_talkview` you should be able to write a view for sponsors if you wanted to.


.. _volto-component-component-label:

A React component
-----------------

React components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

* You can write a view component for the current context - like the ``TalkView``.
* You can write a view component that can be selected as view for a set of content objects like the TalkListView.
* You can also write components that are visible on all content objects. In classic Plone we use *viewlets* for that.
* Volto comes with several components like header, footer, sidebar. In fact everything of the UI is build of nested components.
* Inspect existing components with the React Developer Tools.


.. _volto-component-sponsors-label:

The Sponsors Component
----------------------

We will now see how to achieve in Volto frontend the equivalent to the Plone viewlet of chapter :doc:`dexterity_3`.

**Steps to take**

* Copy and customize Footer component.
* Create component to fetch data from backend and to display the fetched data.


.. _volto-component-customizing-label:

Customizing the Footer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can override any component that lives inside Volto's source folder ``frontend/omelette/src/components`` and adapt it to your needs, without touching the original component.

The sponsors shall live in the footer of a page. To customize the given footer component we copy the ``Footer.jsx`` file :file:`frontend/omelette/src/components/theme/Footer/Footer.jsx` from Volto. We insert the copied file to our app regarding the original folder structure but inside our customizations folder :file:`frontend/src/customizations/components/theme/Footer/Footer.jsx`.

In this file ``Footer.jsx`` we can now modify the to be rendered html by adding a subcomponent ``Sponsors``.

Be aware that the following code is JSX. JSX is Javascript that can handle html in a handy way. What you see is a component defined as an arrow function. The function returns markup consisting of enriched html: The tag ``<Sponsors />`` forces a rendering of the Sponsors component.

.. code-block:: jsx
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 4

    const Footer = ({ intl }) => (
      <Segment role="contentinfo" vertical padded>
        <Container>
          <Sponsors />
          <Segment
            basic
            inverted
            color="grey"
            textAlign="center"
            className="discreet"
          >


This will show an additional component. It is visible on all pages as it is a subcomponent of footer. Later on it can be made conditional if necessary.

To create the component ``Sponsors`` we add a folder :file:`frontend/src/components/Sponsors/` with a file :file:`Sponsors.jsx`. In this file we can now define our new component.

Start with a placeholder to see that your registration actually works:

.. code-block:: jsx
    :linenos:

    import React from 'react';

    const Sponsors = () => {
      return <h3>Our sponsors</h3>;
    };

    export default Sponsors;


A component is just a function that returns markup.


Go back to your modified ``Footer`` component. The ``Footer`` component needs to know where to find the added ``Sponsor`` component. We import the ``Sponsor`` component at the top of our modified ``Footer`` component.

:file:`frontend/src/customizations/components/theme/Footer/Footer.jsx`:

.. code-block:: jsx
    :linenos:

    import { Sponsors } from '@package/components';


After restarting the frontend with ``yarn start``, we are now ready to visit an arbitrary page to see the new component. A restart is necessary on newly added files. As long as you just edit existing files of your app, your browser is updating automagically by app configuration.


.. _volto-component-datafetching-label:

Getting the sponsors data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With our ``Sponsors`` component in place we can take the next step and explore Volto some more to figure out how it does data fetching.

As the data is in the backend, we need to find a way to address it. Volto provides various predefined actions to communicate with the backend (fetching data, creating content, editing content, etc). A Redux action (that communicates with the backend) has a common pattern: It addresses the backend via REST API and updates the global app store according to the response of the backend. A component calls an action and has hereupon access to the global app store (shortened: store) with the fetched data.


For more information which actions are already provided by Volto have look at :file:`frontend/omelette/src/actions`.

Our component will use the action ``searchContent`` to fetch data of all sponsors. It takes as arguments the path where to search, the information what to search and an argument with which key the data should be stored in the store. Remember: the result is stored in the global app store.

So if we call the action ``searchContent`` to fetch data of sponsors, that means data of the instances of portal type ``sponsor``, then we can access this data from the store.

The Effect Hook `useEffect` lets you perform side effects in `function components`. We use it to fetch the sponsors data from the backend.

.. code-block:: jsx
    :linenos:

    const dispatch = useDispatch();

    React.useEffect(() => {
      dispatch(
        searchContent(
          '/',
          {
            portal_type: ['sponsor'],
            review_state: 'published',
            fullobjects: true,
          },
          'sponsors',
        ),
      );
    }, [dispatch]);



.. _volto-component-store-label:

Connection of component and store
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's connect the store to our component. The Selector Hook `useSelector` allows a `function component` to connect to the store. 

It's worth exploring the store of our app with the Redux Dev Tools (additional Dev Tools to React Dev Tools) There you can see what is stored in ``state.search.subrequests.sponsors``. And you can walk through time and watch how the store is changing.

.. code-block:: jsx
    :linenos:

    const sponsors = useSelector((state) =>
      groupedSponsorsByLevel(state.search.subrequests.sponsors?.items),
    );

With these both: dispatching the action and a connection to the state in place, the component can call the predefined action `searchContent` and has access to the fetched data via its constant `sponsors`.


The next step is advanced and can be skipped on a first reading. As by now we fetch the sponsors data on mounting event of the component. The mounting is done once on the first visit of a page of our app.
What if a new sponsor is added or a sponsor is published? We want to achieve a re-rendering of the component on changed sponsorship. To subscribe to these changes in sponsorship, we extend our already defined connection.

.. code-block:: jsx
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 1,15

    const content = useSelector((state) => state.workflow.transition);

    React.useEffect(() => {
      dispatch(
        searchContent(
          '/',
          {
            portal_type: ['sponsor'],
            review_state: 'published',
            fullobjects: true,
          },
          'sponsors',
        ),
      );
    }, [dispatch, content]);

Listening to this subscription the component fetches the data from the store if a workflow state changes.


.. _volto-component-presentation-label:

Presentation of the prepared data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the data fetched and accessible in the component constant ``sponsors`` we can
now render the sponsors data. As we have already prepared a dictionary by sponsor level of the list of sponsors, groupedSponsorsByLevel, we can now show a nested list.

.. code-block:: jsx
    :linenos:

    <List>
      {keys(sponsors).map((level) => {
        return (
          <List.Item key={level} className={'sponsorlevel ' + level}>
            <h3>{level.toUpperCase()}</h3>
            <List horizontal>
              {sponsors[level].map((item) => (
                <List.Item key={item['@id']} className="sponsor">
                  {item.logo ? (
                    <Image
                      className="logo"
                      as="a"
                      href={item.url}
                      target="_blank"
                      src={flattenToAppURL(item.logo.scales.preview.download)}
                      size="small"
                      alt={item.title}
                      title={item.title}
                    />
                  ) : (
                    <a href={item['@id']}>{item.title}</a>
                  )}
                </List.Item>
              ))}
            </List>
          </List.Item>
        );
      })}
    </List>

        };

        export default Sponsors;

We group the sponsors by sponsorship level.

An Object ``sponsors`` using the sponsorship level as key helps to build rows with sponsors by sponsorship level.

The Semantic UI compontent *Image* is used to display the logo. It cares about the markup of an html image node with all necessary attributes in place.

We also benefit from Semantic UI component *List* to build our list of sponsors. The styling can be customized but these predefined components help simplifying the code and achieve an app wide harmonic style.
