Write Your Own Python Add-On to Customize Plone
================================================

.. sidebar:: Get the code! (:doc:`More info <code>`)

   Code for the beginning of this chapter::

       git checkout XXX

   Code for the end of this chapter::

        git checkout eggs1

.. _eggs1-create-label:


In this part you will:

* Create a custom Python package :py:mod:`ploneconf.site`
* Modify the buildout to install :py:mod:`ploneconf.site`


Topics covered:

* :py:mod:`plonecli`, a Plone CLI for creating Plone packages
* the structure of python packages


Creating the package
--------------------

Your own code has to be organized as a `Python package <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages>`_. A python package is a directory that follows certain conventions to hold python modules.

We are going to use `plonecli <https://pypi.org/project/plonecli>`_ to create a skeleton package. You only need to fill in some blanks.

.. note::

    :py:mod:`plonecli` uses the :py:mod:`bobtemplates.plone` that offers several Plone-specific templates for :py:mod:`mr.bob`, a project template builder similar to :py:mod:`cookiecutter`.

Install plonecli:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install plonecli

Then create the addon:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ plonecli create addon src/ploneconf.site

The new addon will be created in the :file:`src` directory (*src* is short for *sources*)

You have to answer some questions about the add-on. Press :kbd:`Enter` (i.e. choosing the default value) for most questions except where indicated (enter your GitHub username if you have one, do not initialize a GIT repository, Use Plone 5.2 and python 3.7)::

    --> Author's name [Philip Bauer]:

    --> Author's email [bauer@starzel.de]:

    --> Author's GitHub username: pbauer

    --> Package description [An add-on for Plone]:

    --> Do you want me to initialize a GIT repository in your new package? (y/n) [y]: n

    --> Plone version [5.1]: 5.2

    --> Python version for virtualenv [python2.7]: python3.7

    git init is disabled!
    Generated file structure at /Users/pbauer/workspace/training/buildout/src/ploneconf.site

.. only:: not presentation

    If this is your first python package, this is a very special moment.

    You generated a package with a lot files. It might look like too much boilerplate but all files in this package serve a clear purpose and it will take some time to learn about the meaning of each of them.


Volto Addons
------------

The package that will hold your own code for volto was already created when you installed the frontend with ``create-volto-app``.
The folder :file:`frontend/` that you created in the chapter :ref:`instructions-install_frontend-label` not only holds the  default volto frontend but also gives you the option to extend and customize the frontend.


Eggs
----

When a python package is production-ready you can choose to distribute it as an egg over the python package index, `pypi <https://pypi.org>`_. This allows everyone to install and use your package without having to download the code from github. The over 250 python packages that are used by your current Plone instance are also distributed as eggs.


.. _eggs1-inspect-label:

Inspecting the new package
--------------------------

In :file:`src` there is now a new folder :file:`ploneconf.site` and in there is the new package. Let's have a look at some of the files:

:file:`buildout.cfg`, :file:`.travis.yml`, :file:`.coveragerc`, :file:`requirements.txt`, :file:`MANIFEST.in`, :file:`.gitignores`, :file:`.gitattributes`,
    You can ignore these files for now. They are here to create a buildout only for this package to make distributing and testing it easier.

:file:`README.rst`, :file:`CHANGES.rst`, :file:`CONTRIBUTORS.rst`, :file:`DEVELOP.rst`, :file:`docs/`
    The documentation of your package goes in here.

:file:`setup.py`
    This file configures the package, its name, dependencies and some metadata like the author's name and email address. The dependencies listed here are automatically downloaded when running buildout.

:file:`src/ploneconf/site/`
    The python code of your package itself lives inside a special folder structure.
    That seems confusing but is necessary for good testability.
    Our package contains a `namespace package <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/>`_ called *ploneconf.site* and because of this there is a folder :file:`ploneconf` with a :file:`__init__.py` and in there another folder :file:`site` and in there finally is our code.
    From the buildout's perspective your code is in :file:`{your buildout directory}/src/ploneconf.site/src/ploneconf/site/{real code}`


.. note::

    Unless discussing the buildout we will from now on silently omit these folders when describing files and assume that :file:`{your buildout directory}/src/ploneconf.site/src/ploneconf/site/` is the root of our package!


:file:`configure.zcml` (:file:`src/ploneconf/site/configure.zcml`)
    The phone book of the distribution. By reading it you can find out which functionality is registered using the component architecture. There are more registrations in other zcml-files in this addons (e.g. :file:`browser/configure.zcml`, :file:`upgrades.zcml` and :file:`permissions.zcml`) that are included in your main :file:`configure.zcml`

:file:`setuphandlers.py` (:file:`src/ploneconf/site/setuphandlers.py`)
    This holds code that is automatically run when installing and uninstalling our add-on.

:file:`interfaces.py` (:file:`src/ploneconf/site/interfaces.py`)
    Here a browserlayer is defined in a straightforward python class. We will need it later.

:file:`testing.py`
    This holds the setup for running tests.

:file:`tests/`
    This holds the tests.

:file:`browser/`
    This directory is a python package (because it has a :file:`__init__.py`) and will by convention hold most things that are visible in the browser.

:file:`browser/configure.zcml`
    The phonebook of the browser package. Here views, resources and overrides are registered.

:file:`browser/overrides/`
    This folder is here to allow overriding existing default Plone templates.

:file:`browser/static/`
    A directory that holds static resources (images/css/js). The files in here will be accessible through URLs like ``++resource++ploneconf.site/myawesome.css``

:file:`locales/`
    This directory can hold translations of text used in the package to allow for multiple languages of your user-interface.

:file:`profiles/default/`
    This folder contains the GenericSetup profile. During the training we will put some XML files here that hold configuration for the site.

:file:`profiles/default/metadata.xml`
    Version number and dependencies that are auto-installed when installing our add-on.

..    profiles/uninstall/
      This folder holds another GenericSetup profile. The steps in here are executed on uninstalling.

.. note::

    This seems like a lot of complicated boilerplate. In fact a Plone-package can be much smaller and simpler. See https://github.com/starzel/minimal for a minimal example.
    But as stated above the stucture of the package and every part of it serves a well-defined purpose.

    When you are working on large projects you will appreciate the best-practices laid down in this package.


.. _eggs1-include-label:

Including the package in Plone
-----------------------------------

Before we can use our new package we have to tell Plone about it. Look at :file:`buildout.cfg` and see how ``ploneconf.site`` is included in `auto-checkout`, `eggs` and `test`:

.. code-block:: cfg
    :emphasize-lines: 2, 30, 38

    auto-checkout +=
        ploneconf.site
    #    starzel.votable_behavior

    parts =
        checkversions
        instance
        mrbob
        packages
        robot
        test
        zopepy

    eggs =
        Plone
        Pillow

    # development tools
        plone.api
        plone.reload
        Products.PDBDebugMode
        plone.app.debugtoolbar
        Products.PrintingMailHost
        pdbpp

    # TTW Forms
        collective.easyform

    # The add-on we develop in the training
        ploneconf.site

    # Voting on content
    #    starzel.votable_behavior

    zcml =

    test-eggs +=
        ploneconf.site [test]

This tells Buildout to add the egg :py:mod:`ploneconf.site`. The sources for this eggs are defined in the section ``[sources]`` at the bottom of :file:`buildout.cfg`.

.. code-block:: cfg
    :emphasize-lines: 2

    [sources]
    ploneconf.site = git https://github.com/collective/ploneconf.site.git pushurl=git@github.com:collective/ploneconf.site.git
    starzel.votable_behavior = git https://github.com/collective/starzel.votable_behavior.git pushurl=git://github.com/collective/starzel.votable_behavior.git

This tells buildout to not download it from pypi but to do a checkout from GitHub put the code in :file:`src/ploneconf.site`.

..  note::

    The package :py:mod:`ploneconf.site` is now downloaded from GitHub and automatically in the branch master. :py:mod:`ploneconf.site` can be called an egg even though it has not been released on pypi. Plone can use it like it uses an egg.

..  note::

    If you do **not** want to use the prepared package for ploneconf.site from GitHub but write it yourself (we suggest you try that) then add the following instead:

    ..  code-block:: cfg
        :emphasize-lines: 2

        [sources]
        ploneconf.site = fs ploneconf.site path=src
        starzel.votable_behavior = git https://github.com/collective/starzel.votable_behavior.git pushurl=git://github.com/collective/starzel.votable_behavior.git

    This tells buildout to expect `ploneconf.site` in :file:`src/ploneconf.site`.
    The directive ``fs`` allows you to add eggs on the filesystem without a version control system.

Now run buildout to reconfigure Plone with the updated configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./bin/buildout

After restarting Plone with :command:`./bin/instance fg` the new add-on :py:mod:`ploneconf.site` is available for install like EasyForm or Plone True Gallery.

We will not install it now since we did not add any of our own code or configuration yet. Let's do that next.


Exercises
---------

1. Create a new package called :py:mod:`collective.behavior.myfeature`. Inspect the directory structure of this package. Delete it after you are done. Many packages that are part of Plone and some add-ons use a *nested namespace* such as :py:mod:`plone.app.contenttypes`.

2. Open https://github.com/plone/bobtemplates.plone and read about the templates and subtemplates it provides.


Summary
-------

* You created the package :py:mod:`ploneconf.site` to hold your code.
* You added the new package to buildout so that Plone can use it.
* In one of the next chapter we will also create a addon for Volto, the React frontend.
