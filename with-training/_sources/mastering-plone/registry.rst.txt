==============================================================

.. todo::

    * Add a Volto Controlpanel (in a later chapter?)
    * Add fields and vocabularies for ``audience`` and ``type_of_talk``


.. sidebar:: Get the code! (:doc:`More info <code>`)

   Code for the beginning of this chapter::

       git checkout dexterity_3

   Code for the end of this chapter::

        git checkout registry


In this part you will:

* Store a custom setting in a registry
* Create a control panel using z3c.form to allow setting that value


Topics covered:

* plone.app.registry
* control panels


The Registry
------------

The registry is used to get and set values stored in records. Each record contains the actual value, as well as a field that describes the record in more detail. It has a nice dict-like API.

All global settings in Plone 5 are stored in the registry.

The registry itself is provided by `plone.registry <https://pypi.org/project/plone.registry>`_ and the UI to interact with it by `plone.app.registry <https://pypi.org/project/plone.app.registry>`_

Almost all settings in ``/plone_control_panel`` are actually stored in the registry and can be modified using its UI directly.

Open http://localhost:8080/Plone/portal_registry and filter for ``displayed_types``. You see can modify the content types that should be shown in the navigation and site map. The values are the same as in http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@navigation-controlpanel but the later form is customized for usability.

A setting
---------

Let's store two values in the registry:

- The date of the conference
- Is talk submission open or closed

You cannot create values through the web; instead, you need to register them using Generic Setup.

Open the file :file:`profiles/default/registry.xml`. You already registered several new settings in there:

- You enabled self registration
- You stored a site logo
- You registered additional criteria usable for Collections


Adding the following code to :file:`registry.xml`. This creates a new value in the registry upon installation of the package.

..  code-block:: xml

    <record name="ploneconf.talk_submission_open">
      <field type="plone.registry.field.Bool">
        <title>Allow talk submission</title>
        <description>Allow the submission of talks for anonymous users</description>
        <required>False</required>
      </field>
      <value>False</value>
    </record>

When creating a new site a lot of settings are created in the same way. See https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/blob/master/Products/CMFPlone/profiles/dependencies/registry.xml to see how :py:mod:`Products.CMFPlone` registers values.

..  code-block:: xml

    <record name="ploneconf.date_of_conference">
      <field type="plone.registry.field.Date">
        <title>First day of the conference</title>
        <required>False</required>
      </field>
      <value>2016-10-17</value>
    </record>


Accessing and modifying values in the registry
----------------------------------------------

In Python you can access the registry like this:


..  code-block:: python

    from plone.registry.interfaces import IRegistry
    from zope.component import getUtility

    registry = getUtility(IRegistry)
    start = registry.get('ploneconf.date_of_conference')

:py:mod:`plone.api` holds methods to make this even easier:

..  code-block:: python

    from plone import api
    api.portal.get_registry_record('ploneconf.date_of_conference')
    api.portal.set_registry_record('ploneconf.talk_submission_open', True)


Add a custom control panel
--------------------------

When you want to add a custom control panel it is usually more convenient to register the fields, not manually as above, but as fields in a schema, similar to that of a content type schema.

For this you define an interface for the schema and a view that auto-generates a form from the schema. In :file:`browser/configure.zcml` add:

..  code-block:: xml

    <browser:page
        name="ploneconf-controlpanel"
        for="Products.CMFPlone.interfaces.IPloneSiteRoot"
        class=".controlpanel.PloneconfControlPanelView"
        permission="cmf.ManagePortal"
        />

Add a file :file:`browser/controlpanel.py`:

..  code-block:: python

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    from datetime import date
    from plone.app.registry.browser.controlpanel import ControlPanelFormWrapper
    from plone.app.registry.browser.controlpanel import RegistryEditForm
    from plone.z3cform import layout
    from zope import schema
    from zope.interface import Interface


    class IPloneconfControlPanel(Interface):

        date_of_conference = schema.Date(
            title=u'First day of the conference',
            required=False,
            default=date(2016, 10, 17),
        )

        talk_submission_open = schema.Bool(
            title=u'Allow talk submission',
            description=u'Allow the submission of talks for anonymous user',
            default=False,
            required=False,
        )


    class PloneconfControlPanelForm(RegistryEditForm):
        schema = IPloneconfControlPanel
        schema_prefix = "ploneconf"
        label = u'Ploneconf Settings'


    PloneconfControlPanelView = layout.wrap_form(
        PloneconfControlPanelForm, ControlPanelFormWrapper)


With this way of using fields you don't have to register the values in :file:`registry.xml`. Instead, you have to register the interface:

..  code-block:: xml

    <records interface="ploneconf.site.browser.controlpanel.IPloneconfControlPanel"
             prefix="ploneconf" />

After reinstalling the package (to load the registry entry) you can access the control panel at http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@ploneconf-controlpanel.

To make it show up in the general control panel at http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@overview-controlpanel you have to register it with GenericSetup.
Add a file :file:`profiles/default/controlpanel.xml`:

..  code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <object name="portal_controlpanel">
      <configlet
          title="Ploneconf Settings"
          action_id="ploneconf-controlpanel"
          appId="ploneconf-controlpanel"
          category="Products"
          condition_expr=""
          icon_expr=""
          url_expr="string:${portal_url}/@@ploneconf-controlpanel"
          visible="True">
        <permission>Manage portal</permission>
      </configlet>
    </object>

Again, after applying the profile (reinstall the package or write a upgrade-step) your control panel shows up in http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@overview-controlpanel.


Vocabularies
------------

Do you remember the field `rooms`? We provided several options to chose from.
But who says that the next conference will have the same rooms?
These values should be configurable by the admin.
The admin could go to the Dexterity control panel and change the values but we will use a different approach.
We will allow the rooms to be added in the control panel and use these values in the talk-schema by registering a vocabulary.

Add a new field to :py:class:`IPloneconfControlPanel`:

..  code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    rooms = schema.Tuple(
        title=u'Available Rooms for the conference',
        default=(u'101', u'201', u'Auditorium'),
        missing_value=None,
        required=False,
        value_type=schema.TextLine(),
    )

Create a file :file:`vocabularies.py` and write the vocabulary:

..  code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    from plone import api
    from plone.app.vocabularies.terms import safe_simplevocabulary_from_values
    from zope.interface import provider
    from zope.schema.interfaces import IVocabularyFactory

    @provider(IVocabularyFactory)
    def RoomsVocabularyFactory(context):
        values = api.portal.get_registry_record('ploneconf.rooms')
        return safe_simplevocabulary_from_values(values)

You can now register this vocabulary as a named utility in :file:`configure.zcml` as `ploneconf.site.vocabularies.Rooms`:

..  code-block:: xml

    <utility
        name="ploneconf.site.vocabularies.Rooms"
        component="ploneconf.site.vocabularies.RoomsVocabularyFactory" />

From now on you can use this vocabulary by only referring to its name `ploneconf.site.vocabularies.Rooms`.

Note:

* Plone comes with many useful vocabularies that you can use in your own projects. See https://github.com/plone/plone.app.vocabularies/ for a list of them.
* We turn the values from the registry into a dynamic `SimpleVocabulary` that can be used in the schema.
* You could use the context with which the vocabulary is called or the request (using `getRequest` from `from zope.globalrequest import getRequest`) to constrain the values in the vocabulary.
* We use the handy helper method `safe_simplevocabulary_from_values` to create the vocabulary since the `token` of a `SimpleTerm` in a `SimpleVocabulary` needs to be bytes, not unicode.
* You can write your own helper to further control the creation of the vocabulary terms. The `value` is stored on the object, the `token` used to communicate with the widget during editing and `title` is what is displayed in the widget.
  This example allows you to translate the displayed title while keeping the value stored on the object the same in all languages:

  ..  code-block:: python

      from binascii import b2a_qp
      from ploneconf.site import _
      from zope.schema.vocabulary import SimpleTerm
      from zope.schema.vocabulary import SimpleVocabulary

      def simplevoc(values):
          return SimpleVocabulary(
              [SimpleTerm(value=i, token=b2a_qp(i.encode('utf-8')), title=_(i)) for i in values],
          )

Use the new vocabulary in the talk schema. Edit :file:`content/talk.xml`

..  code-block:: xml
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 7

    <field name="room"
           type="zope.schema.Choice"
           form:widget="z3c.form.browser.radio.RadioFieldWidget"
           security:write-permission="cmf.ReviewPortalContent">
      <description></description>
      <title>Room</title>
      <vocabulary>ploneconf.site.vocabularies.Rooms</vocabulary>
    </field>


In a Python schema, that would look like this:

..  code-block:: python

    directives.widget(room=RadioFieldWidget)
    room = schema.Choice(
        title=_(u'Room'),
        vocabulary='ploneconf.site.vocabularies.Rooms',
        required=False,
    )

An admin can now configure the rooms available for the conference.

We could use the same pattern for the fields `type_of_talk` and `audience`.
