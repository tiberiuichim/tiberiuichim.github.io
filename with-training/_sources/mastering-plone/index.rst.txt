Mastering Plone Development
===========================

This is the documentation for the "Mastering Plone" training.

Mastering Plone is intended as a week-long training for people who are new to Plone or want to learn about the current best practices of Plone development. It can be split in two trainings:

- A beginner training (2 to 3 days) that covers chapters 1-18.
- An advanced training (3 to 5 days) that covers the rest.

At conferences a shortened 2-day version of the advanced training with a slightly modified order is held.

.. todo::

    These chapters are outdated and will probably be removed:

    * :doc:`export_code` (replaced by creating talk as a python schema)

    These chapters are outdated and need to be updated:

    * :doc:`views_1`: We still need browser views with Volto but there needs to be good example why and where?
    * :doc:`testing`: Add information about writeing tests for Volto. Link to new testing training: https://training.plone.org/5/testing/
    * :doc:`dexterity_2`: Shorten to only cover GS and upgrade-steps. Marker interface/behavior is no longer needed with a python talk schema \o/
    * :doc:`frontpage`: Move to a earlier place and build frontpage using the blocks. Should include a listing of features content from :doc:`behaviors_1`

    These chapters teach developing with classing Plone without Volto (i.e. server-side rendering):

    * :doc:`zpt` (replaced by :doc:`volto_semantic_ui`)
    * :doc:`zpt_2` (needs a new chapter on overriding components)
    * :doc:`views_2` (replaced by :doc:`volto_talkview`)
    * :doc:`views_3` (replaced by :doc:`volto_talk_listview`)
    * :doc:`viewlets_1` (replaced by a new chapter)
    * :doc:`events_classic` (replaced by :doc:`events`)
    * :doc:`viewlets_advanced_classic` (replaced by :doc:`viewlets_advanced_classic`)
    * :doc:`theming` (replaced by :doc:`volto_theming`)
