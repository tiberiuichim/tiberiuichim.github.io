How to test a Plone addon
=========================

To better understand how to test a Plone addon, the best thing is to create a new Plone package from scratch
and use it to see different testing techniques.

We are going to use the `plonecli <https://pypi.org/project/plonecli/>`_ tool heavily because it lets you create new Plone packages
and related features such as content types, views, and vocabularies, all using simple commands.

Create Package
--------------

First, we need to install plonecli:

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip install plonecli --user

.. note::

  This command will install plonecli in the user site-packages according to the official documentation.
  Feel free to install it using your preferred alternative method (virtualenv, pipenv, pyenv).

.. note::
  If you have already installed plonecli, please update at least bobtemplates.plone to the most recent version (>= 5.0.1) because there are
  some important fixes needed for this training.

Now we can create a new package:

.. code-block:: console

  $ plonecli create addon plonetraining.testing


Buildout
--------

Run buildout:

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd plonetraining.testing
  $ plonecli build

.. note::

    This command will create a virtualenv, install dependencies and run buildout.


Let's run some tests! plonecli provides some default tests when creating a new package:

.. code-block:: console

  $ plonecli test

Let's run all tests, including robot tests (we will cover these later):

.. code-block:: console

  $ plonecli test --all

.. note::
  If you get an error about missing ``geckodriver``, you will have to install ``geckodriver``. 
  On macOS, you can use ``brew install geckodriver``. 
  On Ubuntu, you can use ``apt install firefox-geckodriver``.
  Then re-run ``plonecli test --all``.
