Styling Your Component
======================

Add stylesheet
==============

To add a stylesheet we simply import the :file:`css` file:

.. code-block:: jsx

    import './App.css';

Exercise

Style the component so that the dot on each item is removed and the question is underlined.

..  admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle

    :file:`App.css`

    .. code-block:: css
        :linenos: 

        .faq-item {
          list-style-type: none;
        }

        .question {
          text-decoration: underline;
        }

    :file:`App.js`

    .. code-block:: jsx
        :linenos: 
        :emphasize-lines: 2,8-9,20-21

        import React, { Component } from "react";
        import "./App.css";

        class App extends Component {
          render() {

                    The mission of the Plone Foundation is to protect and promote Plone.
                    The Foundation provides marketing assistance, awareness, and
                    evangelism assistance to the Plone community. The Foundation also
                    assists with development funding and coordination of funding for
                    large feature implementations. In this way, our role is similar to
                    the role of the Apache Software Foundation and its relationship with
                    the Apache Project.

                    Plone has reached critical mass, with enterprise implementations and
                    worldwide usage. The Foundation is able to speak for Plone, and
                    provide strong and consistent advocacy for both the project and the
                    community. The Plone Foundation also helps ensure a level playing
                    field, to preserve what is good about Plone as new participants
                    arrive.
