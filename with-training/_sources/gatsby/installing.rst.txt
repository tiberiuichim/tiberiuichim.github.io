Installing The Development Environment
======================================

First, we need last LTS NodeJS version (8.12.0 at writing time).
We recommend to use nvm to install NodeJS instead of using your OS-based version.

Install nvm on your system using the instructions and provided script at:

https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install-script

Using nvm we will look up the latest lts version of NodeJS and install it

.. code-block:: console

   nvm install --lts
   nvm use --lts

NodeJS is provided with npm, its package manager, we will use it to install the GatsbyJS CLI

.. code-block:: console

   npm install --g gatsby-cli

.. note:: ``-g`` means the CLI will be available globally in our nvm instance.

Creating a new GatsbyJS site
============================

The CLI allows to initialize a project:

.. code-block:: console

   gatsby new hello-world

This command tells gatsby-cli to create a new GatsbyJS project with the name ``hello-world`` with a basic default file structure.

There are several boilerplates created by the community that allows to bootstrap an application for different use-cases.

These boilerplates are called "starters" and in the `offical site <https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?v=2>`_ you could
find a complete list of available starters. There are starters with some pre-configured themes (for example material-ui or bootstrap), support for authentication, and so on.

There are also some starters that are specialized in integration with some external sources, such as a CMS like Plone or WordPress.
They create a boilerplate with all the configuration to fetch data from the external sources and give some helper methods to build the pages/interface with that specific data, such as the breadcrumbs or navigation.

Data fetching part is usually managed by a different type of plugins called "source-plugins" that can retrieve data from a specific source.

We will cover "source-plugins" in later chapters.

.. note:: To create a new project with a starter, you need to append the github URL of the desired starter in the cli command: ``gatsby new [SITE_DIRECTORY] [URL_OF_STARTER_GITHUB_REPO]``

.. code-block:: console

   cd hello-world
   gatsby develop

This command starts a development server.
You will be able to see and interact with your new site in a development environment at http://localhost:8000.

Now that we have a working installation, let us go deep inside GatsbyJS to see how it works and what are its main parts.
