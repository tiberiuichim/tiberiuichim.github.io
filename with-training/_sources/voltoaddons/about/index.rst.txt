    I have been a web developer since the turn of the millennium, primarily
    as a Zope and Plone developer. That didn't stop me from working on projects
    with Pyramid, VueJS, Tensorflow, Django, Ruby on Rails, Linked Data and XML
    techologies such as XSLT and XQuery. Lately I've set everything aside to
    make room for Volto.

    If there's one thing I can say about Volto is that I'm in awe with it and
    the vision of its initial designers and developers. The fact that it
    exists, the craziness of even thinking about starting this project with
    just a dream and limited resources, this is something that has my deepest
    respect. Sure, it may not be perfect and there's plenty to improve, but it
    has all the qualities that made Plone great from the start: it opens
    a world of possibilities that didn't exist before and most important, it's
    useful right now.
