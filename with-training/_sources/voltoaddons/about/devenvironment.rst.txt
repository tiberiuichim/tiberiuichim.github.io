Developer integration with text editors
=======================================

`Visual Studio Code`_ provides a very good integration with the tooling used by
Volto. If you haven't done Javascript development with VSC so far, you should
check the `VisualStudio Code Javascript guide`__ as it provides a very detailed
overview of the capabilities and required configuration.

For Vim, check language integration packages such as ALE_ or coc.nvim_.
