Q&A
---

Is it possible to customize Volto with an addon?
    Yes, the code path used is the same, so you can use the same convention.
    Make sure you have the ``src/customizations`` folder inside your addon. And
    remember, the customization resolution order follows the same order as the
    addons listed in the ``addons`` key of package.json inside the project.

Can I customize an addon?
    You can customize files from an addon with the same algorithm used for
    Volto.  In the ``src/customizations`` folder, move any Volto customized
    files to the ``src/customizations/volto`` and then customize the addon by
    reconstructing the full path (for example
    ``@plone-collective/datatable-tutorial/CellRenderer/Progress.jsx``) would be the
    full path for the file that customizes
    ``datatable-tutorial/src/CellRenderer/Progress.jsx``

Can I have a theme in an addon?
    Yes, you can alias the ``../../theme.config`` with a ``razzle.extend.js``
    file in the addon root folder. Just don't make changes to the
    ``theme.config`` in the project and don't add any files in the project's
    theme folder.

.. code-block:: jsx

    const modify = (config, { target, dev }, webpack) => {
      const themeConfigPath = `${__dirname}/theme/theme.config`;
      config.resolve.alias['../../theme.config$'] = themeConfigPath;
      config.resolve.alias['../../theme.config'] = themeConfigPath;

      return config;
    };

    module.exports = {
      modify,
    };

How can I avoid customizing components?
    If the component is somehow configurable from Volto's configuration
    registry, for example the default views, the widgets or the route
    renderers, you could wrap them in another component and replace the
    original component in the configuration. Or you could simply customize the
    component with the shadowing mechanism, but inside the new component simply
    reference ``@plone/volto-original/.../path/to/Component`` and reuse/wrap
    the original one.

Can I extend Volto's Express server?
    You can register custom Express middleware. You could, for example, include
    a custom http proxy for ElasticSearch, expose it to the Volto frontend and
    avoid security issues. See volto-corsproxy for a redux-integrated CORS
    proxy

Bundle optimization
-------------------

Once you start approaching the project delivery, you'll need to check your
bundle sizes. Nobody wants to make their visitors wait for a 2 MB gzipped file
before the application becomes interactive.

Volto integrates a solution to split the generated JS code in "chunks", which
will then be loaded on-demand (when the component that uses them is loaded in
browser).

When dealing with React components, it's easy:

.. code-block:: jsx

    const Select = loadable(() => import('react-select'));

But for libraries it's a bit more difficult, as you have to manifest the
library as a React component, which gets passed as parameter to a render prop:

.. code-block:: jsx

    const D3 = loadable.lib(() => import('d3'));

    const FormattedValue = ({ value }) => {
      return (
        <D3 fallback={null}>
          {(d3) => d3.format(value)}
        </D3>
      );
    };

You can analyze your bundle by running:

.. code-block:: sh

    BUNDLE_ANALYZE=true yarn build

If you're running automated builds you can configure a new bundle analyzer with
static output, to save the report in a static html file. See
webpack-bundle-analyzer docs.
