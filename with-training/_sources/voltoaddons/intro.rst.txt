Introduction
============

Who are you?
============

Tell us about yourselves:

* Name, company, country...
* What is your Plone experience?
* What is your JavaScript experience?
* What is your Volto experience?
* What are your expectations for this hands-on session?

What will we do?
================

Some technologies and tools we use during the training:

* React_ & JSX
* Yarn_
* Volto_ and Plone_, of course
* create-volto-app_ and generator-volto_

This training assumes that you have already taken (either in person at a Plone
Conference or online) the existing React and Volto trainings. If you're
following this training course on your own, you should first go through the
:ref:`volto-label` and :ref:`voltohandson-label` trainings.

In a real training the instructor should quickly go through a number of key
concepts of React and Volto development, as a refresher.

.. _React: https://reactjs.org/
.. _Yarn: https://yarnpkg.com
.. _Volto: https://github.com/plone/volto
.. _Plone: https://plone.org
.. _create-volto-app: https://github.com/plone/create-volto-app
.. _generator-volto: https://github.com/plone/generator-volto

What to expect
==============

At the end of this course you will know how to extend Volto using addons, what
are the current capabilities of addons, their pros and cons, how to distribute
addons and how to deploy them.

Roadmap
-------

- bootstrap a Volto project using the generator-volto Yeoman generator
- bootstrap a Volto addon from scratch
- develop a simple Volto block
- write an action/reducer pair for network requests
- connect the block to async data
- learn how to make React code reusable
- learn how to make blocks extensible

The hands-on exercise
=====================

The hands-on exercise will feature developing an addon that provides table
views for data files (CSVs). We will be using real-world patterns and
development models based on the experience gained while developing several
websites that use these types of addons.

We will be facing different challenges and we will be solving them, introducing
or refreshing some of the concepts covered in the previous training classes.
We will cover the proper solution to each challenge and we will provide an
overview of what to expect when developing for Volto.
