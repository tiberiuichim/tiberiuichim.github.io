Tell us about yourselves:

* Name, company, country...
* What is your Plone experience?
* What is your JavaScript experience?
* What is your Volto experience?

What will we do?
================

Some technologies and tools we use during the training:

* React https://reactjs.org/
* Yarn https://yarnpkg.com
* JSX
* Volto https://github.com/plone/volto
* create-volto-app
* Plone!

This training assumes that you have already taken (either in person at a Plone Conference or online) the existing React and Volto trainings.
However, we will be revisiting some of the basic React training concepts along with the Volto customization and extensibility story.

At the end of this course you will know how to extend Volto using addons, what
are the current capabilities of addons, their advantages, how to distribute
them and how to deploy them.

Roadmap
-------

- bootstrap a Volto project using the yo generator
- bootstrap a Volto addon from scratch
- develop a simple Volto block
- write an action/reducer pair for network requests
- connect the block to async data
- split code into generic bits
-

The hands-on exercise
=====================

The hands-on exercise will feature developing an addon that provides table
views for data files (CSVs). We will be using real-world patterns and development models based on experience developing multiple websites that use common addons.

We will be facing different challenges and we will be solving them, introducing or refreshing some of the concepts covered in the previous training classes.
We will cover the proper solution to each challenge and we will provide an overview of what to expect when developing for Volto.
