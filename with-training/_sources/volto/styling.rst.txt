Semantic UI
===========

For styling our website in Volto we use Semantic UI.
Semantic UI uses LESS as the underlaying technology.
By default Volto uses the Pastanaga theme but any theme can be used.
A theme has the following folder structure:

- assets
- collections
- elements
- globals
- modules
- views

The assets folder contains all the images and fonts.
The other folders contain LESS files.
Those less files are separate for each UI component.
For example we have separate files for buttons.
Each UI component has 2 files a ``.variables`` file and an ``.overrides`` file.
The ``.variables`` file contains all the predefined variables which you can override in your theme.
If you want to do more specific customizations you can use the ``.overrides`` file to write your own LESS.

In the globals folder we have the ``site.variables`` and ``site.overrides`` files which contain the site wide styling.
If we want to customize something we can create the same file (including the matching folder structure) in our theme folder.

Changing Base Font
==================

We start by creating the file ``theme/globals/site.variables``.
In this file we can override any value.
We do not need to copy the whole file.
We can add variables we would like to change.
When we want to change the base font, we add the following:

.. code-block:: less

    @fontName : 'Comic Sans MS';

.. warning:: Make sure you have the 'Comic Sans MS' font installed. This is the 'ttf-mscorefonts-installer' package for the Debian linux distribution.

Changing The Breadcrumbs
========================

Change the breadcrumbs so that the divider is pink:

..  admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle

    ``theme/collections/breadcrumb.variables``:

    .. code-block:: less

        @dividerColor: @pink;

Using Overrides
===============

For features which are not supported in Semantic UI through the variables, we can use the overrides files.
Update the breadcrumbs so that the links are underlined.


..  admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle

    ``theme/collections/breadcrumb.overrides``:

    .. code-block:: less

        .ui.breadcrumb a {
          text-decoration: underline;
        }
