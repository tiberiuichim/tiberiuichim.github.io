Header styling
==============

We will start introducing the basic styling for the header.
We use the ``theme/extras/custom.overrides`` to apply general styling to our site theme.

.. note::

    Use this rule of thumb when building Volto themes: use the default Semantic overrides system when the override is site-wide and applies to Semantic components.
    When using your own components and specific theme styling, use instead ``custom.overrides``.
    Applying styling later using this method is much faster than doing it in the Semantic default components.

We want this styling in the Header component:

.. code-block:: less

    .ui.basic.segment.header-wrapper {
      background-color: #191919;
      border-bottom: 1px solid #939393;
      margin-bottom: 20px;
    }

    .ui.basic.segment .header .logo-nav-wrapper {
      justify-content: space-between;
    }

    .logo .ui.image {
      height: 50px;
    }

So we have the familiar black background of plone.com, the right logo height, and the proper flex distribution for the header elements.
Please notice the specificity of the CSS class declarations.
We need them in order to override the original theme.
This is rather common when overriding SemanticUI theme styles because of the high specificity enforced by SemanticUI.

We adjust the navigation menu to match the one on plone.com:

.. code-block:: less

    .navigation .ui.secondary.pointing.menu {
      min-height: initial;
      margin: 0;

      a.item {
        padding: 5px 10px !important;
        margin: 0;
        border: none;
        color: #fff;
        font-size: 14px;
        font-weight: bold;

        &:not(:last-child) {
          margin-right: 5px;
        }

        &:hover {
          background: #212020;
          color: #00a1df;
        }
      }
    }

Then we adjust the margin for the homepage:

.. code-block:: less

    .siteroot .ui.basic.segment.header-wrapper {
      margin-bottom: 0;
    }

Logo
====

We use `component shadowing <#component-shadowing>`_ to customize (and override) Volto original components.
Get the Plone logo (``Logo.svg``) from the ``training-resources`` directory and copy it using this path and name: ``src/customizations/components/theme/Logo/Logo.svg``.

.. note::
    Every time you add a file to the customizations folder or to the theme folder, you must restart Volto for changes to take effect.
    From that point on, the hot reloading should kick in and reload the page automatically.

Header component
================

We will customize the existing Volto header, since the one we want does not differ much from the original.
We will do so by copying the original Volto ``Header`` component from the ``omelette`` folder ``omelette/src/components/theme/Header/Header.jsx`` folder into ``src/customizations/components/theme/Header/Header.jsx``.

.. warning::

    When restarting you will see a error in the terminal since the original ``Header.jsx`` uses relative imports::

        Cannot find module '../../../components'

    When using component shadowing, you'll always need to replace relative import with absolute imports. That means changing ::

        import { Anontools, Logo, Navigation, SearchWidget } from '../../../components';

    to::

        import { Anontools, Logo, Navigation, SearchWidget } from '@plone/volto/components';

We have to make some more changes to that component, such as removing the search widget and the ``Anontools`` component.

This will be the outcome:

.. code-block:: js

    import { Logo, Navigation } from '@plone/volto/components';

    ...

    render() {
      return (
        <Segment basic className="header-wrapper" role="banner">
          <Container>
            <div className="header">
              <div className="logo-nav-wrapper">
                <div className="logo">
                  <Logo />
                </div>
                <Navigation pathname={this.props.pathname} />
              </div>
            </div>
          </Container>
        </Segment>
      );
    }


Component shadowing
===================

We use a technique called **component shadowing** to override an existing Volto component with our local custom version, without having to modify Volto's source code at all.
You have to place the replacing component in the same original folder path inside the ``src/customizations`` folder.

.. note::
    Component shadowing is very much like the good old Plone technique called "JBOT" ("just a bunch of templates"), but you can customize virtually any module in Volto, including actions and reducers, not only components.
