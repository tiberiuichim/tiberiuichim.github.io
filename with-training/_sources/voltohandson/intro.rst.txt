Some technologies and tools we use during the training:

* React https://reactjs.org/

This training assumes that you have already taken (either in person at a Plone Conference or online) the existing React and Volto trainings.
However, we will be revisiting some of the basic React training concepts along with the Volto customization and extensibility story.

What to expect
==============

At the end of this course you will know how to develop a Volto project from scratch to deployment.
Practice is the best way to learn to use developer tools and Volto helpers for building your site.
You will become familiar with Volto customization, theming, and how to get the most out of the Plone REST API.

The hands-on exercise
=====================

The hands-on exercise will feature developing the basics of recreating the plone.com site using Volto.
You can view the current plone.com site to get a sense of what to expect from it.
We will be facing different challenges and we will be solving them, introducing or refreshing some of the concepts covered in the previous training classes.
We will cover the proper solution to each challenge and we will provide an overview of what to expect when developing for Volto.
