Gunicorn
========

`Gunicorn <https://gunicorn.org/>`_ is another widely used WSGI server.

Possible Worker models
----------------------

Gunicorn offers a wide range of possible worker models.
The default is the ``sync`` worker model which uses "traditional" multi-threading based on the standard library.
Unlike waitress Gunicorn doesn't use an ``asyncore`` dispatcher to clear the request queue.
Each worker is using `select <https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/blob/e147feaf8b12267ff9bb3c06ad45a2738a4027df/gunicorn/workers/sync.py#L34>`_ by itself to check for incoming client requests.
The official `Gunicorn documentation <http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/design.html#choosing-a-worker-type>`_ recommends to put a buffering proxy in front of a default configuration Gunicorn.

Other possible worker types are asynchronous workers based on `greenlets <https://greenlet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, `AsyncIO <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio>`_ workers and a `Tornado <https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/>`_ worker class.
The different worker types and how to choose one suitable for your application is covered in detail in the `Gunicorn docs <http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/design.html>`_.

Use gunicorn in our buildout
----------------------------

.. sidebar:: Build now

    Run buildout for this section:

    ..  code-block:: bash

        buildout -c gunicorn.cfg

Gunicorn has a built-in PasteDeploy entry point, so we don't need a shim package like the one we used for ``bjoern``.
On the downside, there is no easy way of passing ``plone.recipe.zope2instances http-address`` parameter to gunicorn since the ``bind`` directive doesn't seem to work in the ``ini`` file.
The PasteDeploy entry point is covered in the `gunicorn documentation <http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/configure.html>`_.

We resolve to hard code the socket in the ``ini`` template.

From ``templates/gunicorn.ini.in``:

.. code-block:: ini

    [server:main]
    use = egg:gunicorn#main
    host = 0.0.0.0
    port = 8080
    proc_name = plone

    [app:zope]
    use = egg:Zope#main
    ...

We use this template in our buildout and add ``gunicorn`` to our list of eggs:

.. code-block:: ini

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    user = admin:admin
    zeo-client = on
    zeo-address = 8100
    shared-blob = on
    blob-storage = ${buildout:directory}/var/blobstorage
    eggs =
        Plone
        wsgitraining.site
        gunicorn
    wsgi-ini-template = ${buildout:directory}/templates/gunicorn.ini.in

Alternative method for using gunicorn
-------------------------------------

.. sidebar:: Build now

    Run buildout for this section:

    ..  code-block:: bash

        buildout -c gunicorn-alt.cfg

An alternative method for using gunicorn with Plone is taken from the `Plone Core Development Buildout <https://github.com/plone/buildout.coredev>`_ bypasses ``plone.recipe.zope2instances`` wsgi-ini-template option and builds three more parts instead.
These parts are working together to create the gunicorn configuration and startup scripts.
We do not use an ``ini`` template in this case but rather use inline templates to render the gunicorn command line and the WSGI application entry point in two scripts:

.. code-block:: ini

    [buildout]
    extends = base.cfg
    parts +=
        gunicorn
        gunicornapp
        gunicorn-instance

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    user = admin:admin
    zeo-client = on
    zeo-address = 8100
    shared-blob = on
    blob-storage = ${buildout:directory}/var/blobstorage
    eggs =
        Plone
        wsgitraining.site

    [gunicornapp]
    recipe = collective.recipe.template
    input = inline:
        from Zope2.Startup.run import make_wsgi_app
        wsgiapp = make_wsgi_app({}, '${buildout:parts-directory}/instance/etc/zope.conf')
        def application(*args, **kwargs):return wsgiapp(*args, **kwargs)
    output = ${buildout:bin-directory}/gunicornapp.py

    [gunicorn]
    recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    eggs =
        gunicorn
        ${instance:eggs}
    scripts =
        gunicorn

    [gunicorn-instance]
    recipe = collective.recipe.template
    input = inline:
        #!/bin/sh
        ${buildout:directory}/bin/gunicorn -b localhost:8080 --threads 4 gunicornapp:application
    output = ${buildout:bin-directory}/gunicorn-instance
    mode = 755

Note that in this case we still create the default instance (using waitress).
But for starting up Plone with gunicorn we use the new ``gunicorn-instance`` script instead, without any parameters:

.. code-block:: bash

    (wsgitraining) $ bin/gunicorn-instance
    [2019-10-01 11:55:41 +0200] [11048] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 19.9.0
    [2019-10-01 11:55:41 +0200] [11048] [INFO] Listening at: http://127.0.0.1:8080 (11048)
    [2019-10-01 11:55:41 +0200] [11048] [INFO] Using worker: threads
    [2019-10-01 11:55:41 +0200] [11051] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 11051

As a side effect we get rid of the deprecation warning for not starting gunicorn with ``--paste``.

.. note::

    The Zope documentations reports several performance issues with gunicorn, s. https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wsgi.html#test-criteria-for-recommendations for details.

Exercise 1
++++++++++

Modify ``gunicorn-alt.cfg`` so it uses the ``eventlet`` worker class. Check the number of database connections in the ZMI. What do you notice?

..  admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle

    You need to add ``eventlet`` to the list of eggs of the ``[gunicorn]`` part and modify the command line for ``[gunicorn-instance]``

    .. code-block:: ini
        :emphasize-lines: 6,15

        ...
        [gunicorn]
        recipe = zc.recipe.egg
        eggs =
            gunicorn
            eventlet
            ${instance:eggs}
        scripts =
            gunicorn

        [gunicorn-instance]
        recipe = collective.recipe.template
        input = inline:
            #!/bin/sh
            ${buildout:directory}/bin/gunicorn -b localhost:8080 --workers 4 gunicornapp:application --worker-class eventlet
        output = ${buildout:bin-directory}/gunicorn-instance
        mode = 755
        ...

    After running ``buildout -c gunicorn-alt.cfg``, you can start the instance with ``gunicorn-instance``.

    Open the `database controlpanel <http://localhost:8080/Control_Panel/Database/main/manage_main>`_ in a browser to check the number of database connection. You will see only one connection despite the 4 workers.
    ZODB connections are `not thread safe <http://www.zodb.org/en/latest/guide/transactions-and-threading.html#concurrency-threads-and-processes>`_ so this is not a recommended configuration.
    The `asyncio <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio>`_ based ``gthread`` worker class (doesn't need additional packages) will show one database connection per worker.
