Deployment
==========

The development bundle served by ``ng serve`` is not optimized for production.

To get a production-ready bundle, we use the following command:

.. code-block:: shell-session

  $ ng build --prod

The resulting bundle is generated in the ``./dist`` folder.

It is just a set of static files and can be served by any HTTP server.

Let's say we deploy it on http://example.com and we use Nginx to serve the files.

If we visit http://example.com, we will see our home page, and if we click on `News`,
we will obtain http://example.com/news thanks to angular-traversal.

But if decide to refresh the page at this point, we will get a 404, because our Nginx server will search for ``/news/index.html`` which does not exist.

So we need to fix our Nginx VHOST to preserve the client-side routing::

  location / {
    try_files   $uri $uri/ /index.html;
  }

This way, any existing file (like ``index.html``, ``vendor.xxx.bundle.js``, etc.) is served directly, but for anything else, we just return ``index.html`` so the client-side routing will take over.
