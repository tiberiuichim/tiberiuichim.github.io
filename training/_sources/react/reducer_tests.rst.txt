Write Tests For Your Reducers

Reducer Tests
=============

Since reducers are pure functions with input and output we can write unit tests for them.
We will start by adding a test for the :file:`ADD_TODO` action in a file called :file:`reducers/faq.test.js`:

.. code-block:: jsx
    :linenos: 
    :emphasize-lines: 1-16

    import faq from "./faq";

    describe("faq", () => {
      it("is able to handle the add faq item action", () => {
        expect(
          faq([], {
            type: "ADD_FAQ_ITEM",
            question: "What is the answer to life the universe and everything?",
            answer: 42
          })
        ).toEqual([{
          question: "What is the answer to life the universe and everything?",
          answer: 42
        }]);
      });
    });

Exercise
========

Add the unit tests for the edit and the delete actions for the reducer.

..  admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle

    .. code-block:: jsx
        :linenos: 
        :lineno-start: 16
        :emphasize-lines: 1-32

        it("is able to handle the edit faq item action", () => {
          expect(
            faq(
              [{
                question: "What is the answer to life the universe and everything?",
                answer: 42
              }], {
                type: "EDIT_FAQ_ITEM",
                index: 0,
                question: "What is the answer to life the universe and everything?",
                answer: 43
              }
            )
          ).toEqual([{
            question: "What is the answer to life the universe and everything?",
            answer: 43
          }]);
        });

        it("is able to handle the delete faq item action", () => {
          expect(
            faq(
              [{
                question: "What is the answer to life the universe and everything?",
                answer: 42
              }], {
                type: "DELETE_FAQ_ITEM",
                index: 0
              }
            )
          ).toEqual([]);
        });
