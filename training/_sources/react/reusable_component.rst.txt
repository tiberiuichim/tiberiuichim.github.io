Convert To A Reusable Component
===============================

Create A Reusable component
===========================

To reuse the markup of a FAQ item we will split up the code.
The app component will contain just the data of the FAQ item and will render
a newly created sub component called :file:`FaqItem`.
The data is passed to the sub component using properties.
In the :file:`FaqItem` component you will have access to the properties with :file:`this.props.question` for example.
The :file:`App.js` code will be changed to:

.. code-block:: jsx
    :linenos: 
    :emphasize-lines: 2,9-29

    import React, { Component } from "react";
    import FaqItem from "./components/FaqItem";
    import "./App.css";

    class App extends Component {
      render() {
        return (
          <ul>
            <FaqItem
              question="What does the Plone Foundation do?"
              answer="
                The mission of the Plone Foundation is to protect and promote Plone.
                The Foundation provides marketing assistance, awareness, and
                evangelism assistance to the Plone community. The Foundation also
                assists with development funding and coordination of funding for
                large feature implementations. In this way, our role is similar to
                the role of the Apache Software Foundation and its relationship with
                the Apache Project."
            />
            <FaqItem
              question="Why does Plone need a Foundation?"
              answer="
                Plone has reached critical mass, with enterprise implementations and
                worldwide usage. The Foundation is able to speak for Plone, and
                provide strong and consistent advocacy for both the project and the
                community. The Plone Foundation also helps ensure a level playing
                field, to preserve what is good about Plone as new participants
                arrive."
            />
          </ul>
        );
      }
    }

    export default App;

Exercise
========

Create the :file:`FaqItem` component in a newly created folder called :file:`components` which renders the same output.
Also move all the styling of the view to :file:`components/FaqItem.css`.

..  admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle

    .. code-block:: jsx
        :linenos: 

        import React, { Component } from "react";
        import "./FaqItem.css";

        class FaqItem extends Component {
          render() {
            return (
              <li className="faq-item">
                <h2 className="question">{this.props.question}</h2>
                <p>{this.props.answer}</p>
              </li>
            );
          }
        }

        export default FaqItem;

Property Validation
===================

React has a builtin mechanism to validate the properties being passed in into a component.
When incorrect values are passed you will receive a warning in the console.
In the above example you have to add an extra import:

.. code-block:: jsx

    import PropTypes from "prop-types";

And the following static property to the class to validate the properties:

.. code-block:: jsx

    static propTypes = {
      question: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
      answer: PropTypes.string.isRequired
    };

If you now add a third empty <FaqItem> to :file:`App.js`,
errors of missing properties on this component call will be reported in the Javascript console of your browser.

    .. code-block:: jsx
        :linenos: 
        :emphasize-lines: 2,7-10

        import React, { Component } from "react";
        import PropTypes from "prop-types";
        
        import "./FaqItem.css";

        class FaqItem extends Component {
          static propTypes = {
            question: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
            answer: PropTypes.string.isRequired
          };

          render() {
            return (
              <li className="faq-item">
                <h2 className="question">{this.props.question}</h2>
                <p>{this.props.answer}</p>
              </li>
            );
          }
        }

        export default FaqItem;
