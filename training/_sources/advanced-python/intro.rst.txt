About this course
=================

This one day course invites you to build your own micro web framework
in Python. It will help you to fundamentally understand how common Python
web frameworks work.

To get the most out of this course, it is expected that you already have
some experience working with Python and some background on web development
with Python.

We will start by exploring WSGI, a Python protocol for connecting Python
application to web servers. We continue our journey to build the
framework using Python language features which might be less familiar
to Python beginners and maybe even developers with several years of
experience in Python.

These topics are Python's data model, meta-classes and functional
programming.
