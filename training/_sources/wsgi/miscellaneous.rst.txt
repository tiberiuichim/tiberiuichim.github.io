Can I talk to the supervisor?
=============================

Miscellaneous topics that are related to Plone and WSGI but do not fit anywhere else (yet).

Install Plone using pip
-----------------------

The official Zope documentation provides instructions on how to `install Zope with pip <https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INSTALL.html#installing-zope-with-pip>`_.
It uses pip's ``-c`` option to specify a ``constraints.txt`` file that contains the version information (the known good set of package versions), similar to ``versions.cfg`` in ``zc.buildout``.
This is at the moment not possible with Plone because of a bug in ``z3c.autoinclude``.
``z3c.autoinclude`` is not capable of resolving module paths of ``pip`` installed packages.
See `this pull request <https://github.com/zopefoundation/z3c.autoinclude/pull/2>`_ for some information.

Protocols other than HTTP (FTP, WebDAV, ...)
--------------------------------------------

Currently there is no straightforward way for using protocols other than HTTP in a Plone WSGI setup, FTP and WebDAV being the most important ones.
See https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/2537.
