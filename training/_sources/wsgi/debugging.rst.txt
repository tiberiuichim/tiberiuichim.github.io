Debugging Plone on WSGI
=======================

When debugging Plone behind a WSGI server, there are a couple of things to remember.
The ``wsgitraining.site`` package contained in our buildout comes with a debugging view that sets a breakpoint:

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 5

    class DebuggingView(BrowserView):

         def __call__(self):
             self.msg = _(u'A small message')
             import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
             return self.index()

It is available at `<http://localhost:8080/Plone/debugging-view>`_.

It also provides a very basic view that raises an ``AttributeError`` available at `<http://localhost:8080/Plone/attribute-error-view>`_.

Debugging with waitress
-----------------------

Debugging with waitresss doesn't feel different from what you know from ZServer.
Limiting to one worker thread might make debugging easer for you.

The widely used ``pdbpp``, ``Products.PdbDebugMode``, ``plone.app.debugtoolbar`` and ``Products.enablesettrace`` add-ons also work as expected.

werkzeug debugging
------------------

.. sidebar:: Build now

    Run buildout for this section:

    ..  code-block:: bash

        buildout -c werkzeugdebugger.cfg

The werkzeug WSGI server provides an additional `debugging WSGI middleware <https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/0.16.x/debug>`_ that renders tracebacks and also provides an interactive debug console.
To quote from this `blog post <https://labs.detectify.com/2015/10/02/how-patreon-got-hacked-publicly-exposed-werkzeug-debugger/>`_ this is basically remote remote code execution by design, so never use the werkzeug debugger in production (although the original vulnerability has been mitigated by introducing a debugger PIN).

To get this working for Plone we first have to disable our standard exception views.
We can do this by means of an additional option in the ``[instance]`` buildout part:

.. code-block:: ini
    :emphasize-lines: 9

    ...
    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    user = admin:admin
    zeo-client = on
    zeo-address = 8100
    shared-blob = on
    blob-storage = ${buildout:directory}/var/blobstorage
    debug-exceptions = on
    eggs =
        Plone
        Pillow
        wsgitraining.site
        dataflake.wsgi.werkzeug
    wsgi-ini-template = ${buildout:directory}/templates/werkzeugdebugger.ini.in

We also have to specify the correct entry point in the ``ini`` template to use the werkzeug debugger:

.. code-block:: ini
    :emphasize-lines: 2

    [server:main]
    use = egg:dataflake.wsgi.werkzeug#debugger
    hostname = 127.0.0.1
    port = 8080
    ...

Start the instance with ``bin/instance fg``.
Use the ``attribute-error-view`` from the training add-on to see a traceback rendered by werkzeug debugger.
If you move the mouse to the right of a stack frame, you will see a symbol of a terminal.
Click on it.
You will be prompted for a PIN once.
Enter the PIN provided on the console where you started the instance.
You will see an interactive console in the browser where you can enter arbitrary Python code.

Debugging uWSGI
---------------

When trying to open the debugging view in uWSGI, you will see an error message in both console and the browser instead of the pdb prompt.

.. code-block:: bash

    > /home/thomas/devel/plone/wsgitraining_buildout/src/wsgitraining.site/src/wsgitraining/site/views/debugging_view.py(18)__call__()
    -> return self.index()
    (Pdb)
    ERROR:Zope.SiteErrorLog:1570455986.90912460.23307293753294422 http://localhost:8080/Plone/debugging-view
    Traceback (innermost last):
      Module ZPublisher.WSGIPublisher, line 155, in transaction_pubevents
      Module ZPublisher.WSGIPublisher, line 337, in publish_module
      Module ZPublisher.WSGIPublisher, line 255, in publish
      Module ZPublisher.mapply, line 85, in mapply
      Module ZPublisher.WSGIPublisher, line 61, in call_object
      Module wsgitraining.site.views.debugging_view, line 18, in __call__
      Module wsgitraining.site.views.debugging_view, line 18, in __call__
      Module bdb, line 88, in trace_dispatch
      Module bdb, line 113, in dispatch_line
    bdb.BdbQuit

To make uWSGI stop at the ``pdb.set_trace()`` you need to start it with the ``honour-stdin`` flag set to ``true``.
`This flag <https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Options.html#honour-stdin>`_ will prevent uWSGI from redirecting ``stdin`` to ``/dev/null``, which is the default behaviour.
You can do so by modifying the inline template in the ``[uwsgiini]`` part and rerun buildout.

.. code-block:: ini
    :emphasize-lines: 11,14

    ...
    [uwsgiini]
    recipe = collective.recipe.template
    input = inline:
        [uwsgi]
        http-socket = 0.0.0.0:8080
        socket = 127.0.0.1:8081
        chdir  = ${buildout:directory}/bin
        module = wsgi:application
        master = false
        honour-stdin = true
        enable-threads = true
        processes = 1
        threads = 1
    output = ${buildout:directory}/etc/uwsgi.ini
    ...

After running buildout and starting your instance with ``bin/uwsgi-instance`` you will see an interactive console and uWSGI will not serve any requests at first (the browser will hang forever instead of showing a page).

.. code-block:: bash

    *** Operational MODE: single process ***
    Class Products.CMFFormController.ControllerPythonScript.ControllerPythonScript has a security declaration for nonexistent method 'ZPythonScriptHTML_changePrefs'
    Class Products.CMFFormController.ControllerValidator.ControllerValidator has a security declaration for nonexistent method 'ZPythonScriptHTML_changePrefs'
    /home/thomas/.buildout/eggs/cp37m/pyScss-1.3.5-py3.7-linux-x86_64.egg/scss/selector.py:54: FutureWarning: Possible nested set at position 329
      ''', re.VERBOSE | re.MULTILINE)
    WARNING:plone.behavior:Specifying 'for' in behavior 'Tiles' if no 'factory' is given has no effect and is superfluous.
    >>>

Press ``Ctrl+D`` to continue the instance startup:

.. code-block:: bash

    >>>
    now exiting InteractiveConsole...
    WSGI app 0 (mountpoint='') ready in 52 seconds on interpreter 0x55fe3f766d30 pid: 7018 (default app)
    *** uWSGI is running in multiple interpreter mode ***
    spawned uWSGI worker 1 (and the only) (pid: 7018, cores: 1)
    ...

Now if you open the ``debugging-view`` again you will see the ``pdb`` prompt.
All looks fine now, however you will not be able to terminate the instance with ``Ctrl+C``.
Instead you can press ``Ctrl+Z`` to send the instance to the background and then kill it with ``kill %1`` (or whatever job number you're seeing on the console).
This behaviour is the reason why we don't put ``honour-stdin`` in the ``.ini`` template by default.
