uWSGI
=====

`uWSGI <https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/>`_ is a very flexible WSGI server that comes with tons of configuration options.
Only a few of them work with Zope and Plone, though.

Possible Worker models
----------------------

* synchronous threading
* asynchronous worker models
* worker processes

Using uWSGI in our buildout
---------------------------

.. sidebar:: Build now

    Run buildout for this section:

    ..  code-block:: bash

        buildout -c uwsgi.cfg

Again we look into the `Plone Core Development Buildout <https://github.com/plone/buildout.coredev>`_ for how to use uWSGI in our buildout.
With 5 additional buildout parts things get even more complex than for gunicorn.
These parts are:

* ``[wsgi.py]`` providing the application entry point
* ``[uwsgi]`` and ``[uwsgi-buildenv]`` needed to build the uWSGI binary
* ``[uwsgiini]`` providing the ``uwsgi.ini`` file.
  The uWSGI ``ini`` configuration is different from the PasteDeploy configurations we have seen with other servers
* ``[uwsgi-instance]`` providing the actual startup script

.. code-block:: ini

    ...
    [wsgi.py]
    recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    eggs =
        ${instance:eggs}
    scripts =
        wsgi.py
    interpreter =
        wsgi.py
    initialization =
        from Zope2.Startup.run import make_wsgi_app;
        wsgiapp = make_wsgi_app({}, '${buildout:parts-directory}/instance/etc/zope.conf')
        def application(*args, **kwargs):return wsgiapp(*args, **kwargs)

    [uwsgi]
    recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    environment = uwsgi-buildenv
    eggs =
        greenlet
        uwsgi
        ${instance:eggs}
    scripts =
        uwsgi

    [uwsgi-buildenv]
    UWSGI_PROFILE="asyncio"

    [uwsgiini]
    recipe = collective.recipe.template
    input = inline:
        [uwsgi]
        http-socket = 0.0.0.0:8080
        socket = 127.0.0.1:8081
        chdir  = ${buildout:directory}/bin
        module = wsgi:application
        # s. https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/283, https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/284
        master = false
        enable-threads = true
        processes = 1
        threads = 4
        #asyncio = 4
        #greenlet = true
    output = ${buildout:directory}/etc/uwsgi.ini

    [uwsgi-instance]
    recipe = collective.recipe.template
    input = inline:
        #!/bin/sh
        ${buildout:directory}/bin/uwsgi --ini ${buildout:directory}/etc/uwsgi.ini
    output = ${buildout:bin-directory}/uwsgi-instance
    mode = 755

Like with gunicorn in the previous chapter, we can start Plone behind uWSGI with the ``uwsgi-instance`` script:

.. code-block:: bash

    (wsgitraining) $ bin/uwsgi-instance
    [uWSGI] getting INI configuration from /vagrant/wsgitraining/etc/uwsgi.ini

As you can see the uWSGI output is pretty verbose.

Exercise 1
++++++++++

Benchmark the front page of your setup with two different tools: `siege <https://www.joedog.org/>`_ and `wrk <https://github.com/wg/wrk>`_.
You will probably find a package for your Linux distribution for at least siege.
If so, use the distribution package, otherwise follow the official installation instructions.

For both tools we use 100 concurrent connections and 100 seconds of test duration.
For siege, the command line looks like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ siege -c 100 -t 100s http://localhost:8080/Plone

For wrk, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ wrk -c 100 -d 100s -t 1 --timeout 300s --latency http://localhost:8080/Plone

Note that siege always uses a single thread to execute the test.
For wrk, you can specify the number of threads to use with the ``-t`` option.

Record and discuss the results.

Using uWSGI Emperor from the distribution
-----------------------------------------

For managing multi-app deployment uWSGI comes with a special feature called Emperor mode.
It is supported by many Linux distributions and also by Ubuntu.
It is controlled by the systemd service manager and can replace supervisor or a generic systemd configuration for Plone.
We want to turn our uWSGI based Plone setup into one that is controlled by the distro's uWSGI Emperor.
To get there, we need to consider a couple of things.
uWSGI uses a plugin based approach to support different programming languages.
It comes with both Python version 2 and 3 plugins.
However the distro's uWSGI Python plugins will match the distro's main Python versions, so for the Python 3 plugin this is Python 3.6 for Ubuntu Bionic.
If we used a different Python version, we have two choices:

* Create a new virtualenv with the main system Python 3 and rerun buildout
* Recompile uWSGIs Python 3 plugin so it matches the Python version we are currently using

Although the first approach has the important advantage that we retain the possibility to obtain updates and security fixes from the distribution, we will go for the second here because it looks more interesting.
We will roughly follow `this blog post <https://www.paulox.net/2019/03/13/how-to-use-uwsgi-with-python-3-7-in-ubuntu-18-x/>`_.

Let's first install the necessary packages:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt install uwsgi-emperor python3-distutils uwsgi-src uuid-dev libcap-dev libpcre3-dev

Next we will rebuild uWSGI's Python 3 plugin (and change to a temporary location before doing so):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd /tmp
    $ PYTHON=python3.7 uwsgi --build-plugin "/usr/src/uwsgi/plugins/python python37"

Then we move the plugin to the location where uWSGI expects to find its plugins:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo mv python37_plugin.so /usr/lib/uwsgi/plugins/python37_plugin.so
    $ sudo chmod 644 /usr/lib/uwsgi/plugins/python37_plugin.so

Note that we are not replacing the existing Python 3 plugin, but we add a new one specifically for Python 3.7.
We can check the Python version of our new plugin:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ uwsgi --plugin python37 -s :0
    ...
    Python version: 3.7.3 (default, Apr  3 2019, 19:16:38)  [GCC 8.0.1 20180414 (experimental) [trunk revision 259383]]
    ...

So now we got a running Plone uWSGI setup and a matching Python 3 plugin.
What is left to do is to setup a Plone vassal for the uWSGI emperor.
You can find general information on this topic in the official `uWSGI documentation <https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Emperor.html>`_.
By default, Ubuntu's uWSGI emperor will run under user/group id ``www-data`` and it will use these settings for its vassals.
However Plone needs to be able to write to the filesystem e.g. for caching and creating compiled files, so we want it to run under the user id we used for running buildout (probably your user name for a local installation or ``vagrant``).
uWSGI emperor comes with a so called "tyrannt mode" for secure multi-user hosting to achieve this, and we go for the `paranoid sysadmins <https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Emperor.html#tyrant-mode-for-paranoid-sysadmins-linux-only>`_ variant here.
Posix capabilities are enabled in Ubuntu's uwsgi by default, so we only need to add two lines to ``/etc/uwsgi-emperor/emperor.ini`` to enable tyrannt mode:

.. code-block:: ini
    :emphasize-lines: 25,26

    # try to autoload appropriate plugin if "unknown" option has been specified
    autoload = true

    # enable master process manager
    master = true

    # spawn 2 uWSGI emperor worker processes
    workers = 2

    # automatically kill workers on master's death
    no-orphans = true

    # place timestamps into log
    log-date = true

    # user identifier of uWSGI processes
    uid = www-data

    # group identifier of uWSGI processes
    gid = www-data

    # vassals directory
    emperor = /etc/uwsgi-emperor/vassals

    emperor-tyrant = true
    cap = setgid,setuid

We also need to create a vassal configuration for Plone.
It will go to ``/etc/uwsgi-emperor/vassals/plone.ini`` and its contents are:

.. code-block:: ini

    [uwsgi]
    uid = vagrant
    gid = vagrant
    http-socket = 0.0.0.0:8080
    socket = 127.0.0.1:8081
    plugins = python37
    virtualenv = /vagrant/wsgitraining
    wsgi-file = /vagrant/wsgitraining/bin/wsgi.py
    master = false
    enable-threads = true
    processes = 1
    threads = 4

The important (and not quite obvious from the docs, see this `mail post <http://lists.unbit.it/pipermail/uwsgi/2015-March/007918.html>`_) thing to note here as that this file must be owned by the same user we intend to use for running the vassal:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo chown vagrant.vagrant /etc/uwsgi-emperor/vassals/plone.ini

The final step is to restart the uWSGI emperor ``systemd`` service (make sure you have a running ZEO server before this):

.. code-block:: ini

    $ sudo service uwsgi-emperor restart

We can then use ``sudo tail -f /var/log/uwsgi/emperor.log`` to see what is going on.

Exercise 2
++++++++++

Change the Plone vassal configuration so that it uses its own logfile.

..  admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle

    You will first need to add the logfile location to ``/etc/uwsgi/vassals/plone.ini``:

    .. code-block:: ini
        :emphasize-lines: 13

        [uwsgi]
        uid = vagrant
        gid = vagrant
        http-socket = 0.0.0.0:8080
        socket = 127.0.0.1:8081
        plugins = python37
        virtualenv = /vagrant/wsgitraining
        wsgi-file = /vagrant/wsgitraining/bin/wsgi.py
        master = false
        enable-threads = true
        processes = 1
        threads = 4
        daemonize = /var/log/uwsgi/plone.log

    The tricky part however is to get the file permissions right.
    By default, only root is allowed to write to ``/var/log/uwsgi``, but the vassal is running as ``vagrant.vagrant``.
    We resolve to changing the group ownership for ``/var/log/uwsgi`` and giving the group write access:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ sudo chgrp vagrant /var/log/uwsgi
        $ sudo chmod g+w /var/log/uwsgi
        $ ls -ld /var/log/uwsgi
        drwxrwxr-x 2 root vagrant 4096 Oct  2 09:51 /var/log/uwsgi

    Alternatively we could of course write the logfile to a different location, e.g. ``${buildout:directory}/var/log``.
