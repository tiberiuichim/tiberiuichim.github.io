Migrating Content with Transmogrifier
=====================================

:About: Migrating website content into a Plone site using Transmogrifier
:Level: Intermediate Developers


**Training Objective**

This training will cover the necessary steps to export your current site's content
and migrate it to a new Plone site. The import process uses an add-on called
'Transmogrifer'.

In the `Calvin and Hobbes universe <https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/23>`_, the Transmogrifier is an invention of Calvin's that would turn one thing into another.
Similarly, `collective.transmogrifier <https://github.com/mjpieters/collective.transmogrifier>`_
provides support for building pipelines that turn one thing into another, hence greatly facilitating content import and export.
This is a life saver when you need to migrate content from one site to another, regardless of the CMS platform.
