====================================
Exercise 9: Overriding a pattern TTW
====================================

..  warning::

    This exercise requires a working buildout using a fork of the ``collective.jstraining`` package.


In this exercise we will be overriding a pattern through the web.

You will be working in the ``exercise9`` directory of the ``collective.jstraining`` package.

..  note::

    Overriding resources through the web is limited to resources using the ``++plone++`` namespace.
    For more information read https://docs.plone.org/adapt-and-extend/theming/resourceregistry.html#the-plone-traversal-namespace


Installation
============

In this exercise, we will first run the installation

1) Start up your Plone instance
2) Install the ``Exercise 9`` add-on


Try current pattern
===================

Add a new page, and using the source code editor add a ``<p>`` element with the ``exercise9`` pattern

.. code-block:: xml

    <p class="pat-exercise9">test</p>

After saving, you should see ``test Exercise 9 was here``


Choose the pattern to override
==============================

Go to the Site Setup, then to the Resource Registries.

Under the ``Overrides`` tab, pick ``++plone++exercise9/pattern.js``.

Now modify the line:

.. code-block:: xml

    that.$el.append(' <span>Exercise 9 was here</span>');

To be

.. code-block:: xml

    that.$el.append(' <span>Exercise 9 has been overridden</span>');


Recompile bundle
================

Go back to the ``Registry`` tab, and find the ``exercise9`` bundle.

Click the ``Build`` button. Finally, click ``Build it``


Testing
=======

Now, if you go back to the page you added before, you should now see ``test Exercise 9 has been overridden``.
