**Prerequisites**

- Fork https://github.com/collective/collective.jstraining and clone it with git, and install Plone by executing the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    git clone <location of your fork>
    cd collective.jstraining
    ./bootstrap.sh

``<location of your fork>`` should be replaced with where your fork is.

- npm/nodejs install on your system

- webpack installed on your system

- grunt-cli installed on your system(``npm install -g grunt-cli``)

.. note::

   On macOS versions of npm/nodejs newer than 6.9.1 can make the bundling process fail.
   Installing and using version 6.9.1 fixes the problem.
   Different versions of nodejs can be managed with nvm (Node Version Manager).
